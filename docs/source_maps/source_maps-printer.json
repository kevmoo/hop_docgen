These data types are great for tracking\nsource locations on source maps, but they can also be used by tools to\nreporting useful error messages that include on source locations.\n</code></pre><ul><li>\n<p>A builder that creates a source map programatically and produces the encoded\nsource map format.</p></li><li>\n<p>A parser that reads the source map format and provides APIs to read the\nmapping information.</p></li></ul>\n<p>Some upcoming features we are planning to add to this package are:\n  * A printer that lets you generate code, but record source map information in</p>\n<pre><code>the process.\n</code></pre><ul><li>\n<p>A tool that can compose source maps together. This would be useful for\ninstance, if you have 2 tools that produce source maps and you call one with\nthe result of the other.</p></li></ul>"}
